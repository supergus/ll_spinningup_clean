4th experiment was only using rmse in reward, no base value, no regularization.
Controllers VERY active (but effective!).
This time, try to calm them down with some regularization = 0.5

Next: Add some base reward. Agent is learning to perform well with short episodes... we
want policies that "run smoothy" for some time into the future...

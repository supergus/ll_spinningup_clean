# Check controller and env modes. OK? Grid search?
# Open up controller limits in env, just use action limits in main script
# Evaluate
# Try another algo? TD3, SAC


# GPU vs CPU only?


# TODO: When saving config JSON, also save env.info() so we can audit environment parameters.

# TODO: Saving of model... is it overwriting each epoch or only if "improved" performance?

# TODO: Create method to read config JSON & env.info() & controller info & epochs elapsed & load model, then
#  resume training. Important - with 20+ hrs of training time, you WILL lose power etc.
#  Can we also load progress through GridSearch?
